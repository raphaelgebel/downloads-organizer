## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Change the downloadsFilePath variable (in line 11) in the [Main.java](http://Main.java) script to the absolute file path of the downloads folder on your computer.
3. Generate a Runnable JAR file.
4. Add the Runnable JAR file to the Windows Task Scheduler to have your downloads folder organized automatically.
(Steps 3 and 4 are only necessary if you want to fully automate the organization of the downloads folder. Of course the script can also be run normally.)
